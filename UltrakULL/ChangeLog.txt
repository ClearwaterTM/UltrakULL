0.8.3

- Added a string for the tutorial before 0-1 for the Discord Rich Presence.
- Added the "under construction" string for weapons not yet available in the game.
- Added the Soul Orbs string for weapon preset selection, when not enough Soul Orbs have been collected to unlock a preset.
- Fixed a standing issue with previous patched code causing saves to not be deleted correctly.
- Fixed P-2 and P-3 using P-1's name in the level select.

- Added the following lines to the JSON template: 

misc: weapons_underConstruction
levelNames: levelName_tutorial
shop: shop_soulOrbs


0.8.2 EMERGENCY FIX
- Fixed a major visual bug where unlocked levels would sometimes incorrectly appear as locked. (Liquid)

0.8.2

- Reverted a section of patched code that was causing a major bug where saves would not be saved and deleted correctly. I will look into a working fix for this at a later date. (Liquid)
NOTE: This reversion will make the save deletion confirmation text revert back to English.
- Added a new "Language" tab in the options menu. Full credit to Temperz87 fof the UI code.
(NOTE: A lot of the functionality in here is not yet working pending future development)
- Added a check to make sure the version of a JSON language file matches that of the current mod version. If a JSON file's version does not match the current version of the mod, you will receieve warning messages in-console and in-game regarding potential missing strings.
(NOTE: In future, outdated or mismatched files will be skipped over, however a file can be force loaded at any time by setting it in lastLang.)
- Added strings for the Sandbox tab and descriptions in the shop.
- Added strings for the end of Early Access panel after 6-2. (Paoletto?)
(NOTE: This will inevitably be removed once Act 3 releases this time next year or the next, but until then, here it is.)
- Fixed obtained ranks on finished levels not appearing on the level select, if a layer was not 100% P-Ranked. (Paoletto and someone else)
- Fixed challenge titles not being translated for uncompleted levels. (Paoletto)
- Fixed a missing string in the Mindflayer's bio.
- Fixed the back button when viewing weapon lore and weapon variation info not being translated.

- Added the following lines to the JSON template:

metadata: minimumModVersion (IMPORTANT: If this is not found in the JSON, or does not match the current mod version, you will receive warning messages in-console and on the main menu.)
shop: shop_sandboxTitle
shop: shop_sandboxDescription1
shop: shop_sandboxDescription2
shop: shop_sandboxEnter
misc: earlyAccessEnd1
misc: earlyAccessEnd2
misc: earlyAccessEnd3

0.8.1
- Added a link to the UltrakULL Discord in the main menu.
- Added basic UltrakULL credits to the game credits in the main menu. (NOTE: Plan on moving this to somewhere better in the future. Full credits for all the translation teams to come later with this.)
- Fixed an inconsistency in the tutorial intro text.
- Changed the color of the assist options to use lime instead of blue. This is due to the hex color tag that was being used being broken. Normal colors still work fine, so this string will use a lime color until it has been fixed.
- Fixed 6-2 showing Act 1 Climax instead of Act 2 Climax. (Soulvender)
- Fixed some missed instances of weapon color customization using hardcoded strings. (Paoletto)
- Fixed the opening credits on 0-1 being broken. (?)
- Changed some inner workings of the intro to prevent conflicts and softlocks with certain languages using special chars/accents. (Liquid)
